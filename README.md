<h1>XR Running App</h1>
A Mixed Reality experience to make people's cardio workout fun. This app blends the real-world fitness treadmill with a virtual one and designs workouts to keep users engaged and away from the boredom some might face while training. This is an application built specifically for oculus using the latest features to make it as user-friendly as possible. This is currently being tested in the market for commercial applications so the code is currently not publically available.</br></br>
